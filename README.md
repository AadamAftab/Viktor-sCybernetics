Viktor's Cybernetics: A Ripperdoc's Catalog

PromptCraft Hackathon Submission | Track 1: Cybernetic Implant Catalog

Core Concept

Welcome to Viktor's Cybernetics, your friendly neighborhood ripperdoc's shop. This isn't just a static list; it's an interactive catalog tailored to your "lifepath."

Inspired by the cyberpunk genre, this applet asks the user to identify with a Nomad, Streetkid, or Corpo lifepath. Based on their choice, the inventory dynamically updates to show a curated list of "pre-owned" cybernetics, complete with prices, descriptions, and humorous (or horrifying) side effects.

How This Project Meets the Judging Rubric

This project was built from the ground up to excel in the hackathon's specific criteria, using an AI-assisted, "no-code" workflow.

1. Cyberpunk Vibe & Theme (35%)

The entire aesthetic is designed to immerse the user in a cyberpunk world:

Typography: Uses Orbitron and Share Tech Mono to give a futuristic, "terminal" feel.

Color & Effects: A dark, neon-first color palette (cyan, magenta) with text shadows, scanline animations, and glitchy hover effects.

Custom Cursors: The cursor changes to a custom "tech" reticle, further separating the user from a standard webpage.

Lore-Driven: The core "lifepath" concept is a direct nod to cyberpunk RPGs, making the user's choice feel personal. The product descriptions are filled with in-genre slang and warnings.

2. Creativity & Originality (30%)

Instead of a simple, static e-commerce grid, this project adds an interactive, original filter. The "Lifepath Selector" makes the experience unique to the user, telling a story about who they are and what "gear" they would have access to. It's a static site that feels dynamic and personal.

3. Functionality & Polish (20%)

This applet is a complete, polished experience with a clear user flow:

Choose a lifepath.

Browse your tailored inventory.

Go back and explore other paths.

It is 100% compliant with the "No Backend" Clause. All "database" content (the products, descriptions, and side effects) is stored in a structured JavaScript const object within the index.html file, which is then used to dynamically render the product cards.

4. AI Tool Mastery (15%)

This entire project was built in adherence to the "AI is Your Only Ally" rule.

Initial Concept & Brainstorming: I used Gemini to brainstorm ideas for Track 1, landing on the "lifepath-filtered" catalog.

Code Generation: The entire index.html file—including the HTML structure, Tailwind CSS, custom "glitch" CSS, and the JavaScript logic for filtering—was generated iteratively through prompts.

Content Generation: All product names, descriptions, and side effects in the products database were generated by AI.

Debugging & Iteration: I worked with the AI to refine the UI, fix layout issues, and implement new features like the custom cursors and back button.
